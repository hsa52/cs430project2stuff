The main objective of this program is to take a json file and print out the image into the output file while making the image the height and width that was passed in. In order to work the program, you need to have all of the files in the directory and add the width, height, path to .json file, and path to the output file. For example, here's the arguments I put into the configurations for it to work on my computer: 
70 70 /Users/Hayden/ClionProjects/cs430proj2things/testimage.json /Users/Hayden/ClionProjects/cs430proj2things/output.ppm
The numbers represent the desired width and height
